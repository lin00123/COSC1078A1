					<p class="introtext">Greetings, my name is Jeff. My background is Chinese, and I was raised in Australia. Until recently,
						I attended high school. It is currently my first year in a University. I can speak a very basic level
						of Chinese and a decent amount of English. In fact, English is my first language. One thing others may
						find interesting about me is that digital art was a hobby of mine until the VCE exams, which was a time
						where I went on a long hiatus. Before then, I won a few awards as a child artist. I’ve never really got
						back into art since then, but I’ve been thinking about it.

				<h2 class="subt">Interest in IT</h2>
				<p class="bodytext0">While creating digital art was a hobby of mine, I have a great interest in technology in general,
					as I am very fascinated about how everything works, and how complicated everything appears to be at first glance.
					I am eager to understand it, as it is something that I grew up with, something that was constantly around me that I never really dug deeper into.
					I really love computers, and anything related to Technology, and RMIT is an opportunity to truly delve into it and potentially make a career out of my knowledge and skills.
					I chose to come to RMIT partly because it was recommended by my high school career advisors.
					I also did a bit of research, and it appears that RMIT takes a more hands-on approach as opposed to other universities, which may benefit me more as I feel that learn better hands-on.
					From my studies, I expect to learn everything from foundations and basics all the way to nuances and advanced concepts around Information Technology as a whole.
					I also wish to learn to slowly grow independent and improve my organisation skills during my studies.

				<h2 class="subt2">Ideal Job</h2>
				<p class="bodytext0">Link to the job advertisement  <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51709889?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=8775fe43-fba4-4b0a-8087-beef91e304fc" style="color:lightgreen;">Here</a></p>
				<p class="bodytext0">This job requires me to become an IT Consultant, essentially solving issues revolving technology including Windows platforms,
					Office 365, networking, and connectivity. I am also required to log calls and make sure all problems I will face are resolved in a timely manner. Teamwork is an aspect that I must not lack, as I am required to be an active contributing team member, working cooperatively to ensure that the objectives are achieved or surpassed.
					Other requirements include an attitude that allows for a great delivery of service and making the customers happy, a hardworking and earnest mindset, great time management,
					being a great communicator, attention to detail, and finally, being honest, responsible, diligent, and knowledgeable. Experience with Autodesk suite, LMTools, BlueBeam, and Photoshop is highly regarded,
					and should be viewed as a requirement for ensuring entry into the job.
					This job appeals to me as not only is it near where I live, it’s a job related to a field I am interested in, and I do not have any issues with the work activities and requirements,
					as with enough hard work and genuine effort, I can easily fulfil them.
					Currently, I have almost no experience in the IT field of work. I have some experience with photoshop, I am honest and am willing to work hard towards a common goal in a team.
					I enjoy servicing customers, and I have a moderate amount of understanding towards technology, though inept compared to tech experts.
					I plan to acquire these skills through the coming years in RMIT, where I will work hard towards procuring and cultivating these skills that are required.

				<p class="bodytext0">These results show that I am quite introverted, a tactile learner, and above average in creativity.
					While I think my introversion may negatively influence my behaviour in a team, I can work on improving my social skills.
					I’ll need to be more open with my ideas and try not to reject them without first listing them out.

				<h2 class="subt2" style="color: #00ffcc; border: 0px solid black" id="itpri">IT Project Idea</h2>
				<p class="bodytext0"> </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p class="itprtxtb">The IT project idea that I will propose is going to be highly ambitious. The idea is that we will <strong>develop a game using the Unity engine</strong>.</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">The game will feature 3D models, as well as an almost free 3rd person camera that follows the player.
					It should be kept simple design-wise and content wise given the time we must complete it by is limited, but the gameplay satisfaction must compensate for the forestated flaws.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">In summary, the idea I have for the game will tentatively be ‘a hack-and-slash fast-paced action bullet-hell RPG, intended to be souls-like’.
				The objective is to reach and defeat a final boss of some sort, and each boss along the way will include challenging yet fun and satisfying mechanics.
				</p>
				<br class="itprtxt"></br>
				<p class="itprtxt">Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many people are either at home in isolation or stressed out.</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">There was a massive burst in popularity for gaming during this pandemic.
					Statistics from Arsenal.gg show that the gaming platform Steam hit peak concurrent user count of more than 20 million people in March 2020.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">NPD stated that during that month, game sales approached $1.6 billion, which is a 35% increase relative to previous years.</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">Though an American analyst, Michael Pachter speculates that gamers will reduce their playtime when the pandemic ends, he believes that the industry will thrive from the newcomers that were exposed to gaming.</p>
				<p class="itprtxt"><em>“A person who was playing zero hours a week and they’re now playing one or two, you may have won them over forever,”</em> Pachter says, from an article from The Washington Post. </p>
				<br class="itprtxt"></br>
				<p class="itprtxt">These data insist that we may have been late to the party, but gaming is still at an all-time high in popularity, so there is always a demand for more games, thus offering us a chance to prove ourselves with our project.
					Speed-running games was a popular trend recently and this game could house that.
				</p>
				<br class="itprtxt"></br>
				<p class="itprtxt">As stated roughly before, the game will be a challenging 3D third-person hack-and-slash fast paced action RPG,
					where the player plays a character that wields a weapon and is hellbent on sweeping floors after floors of enemies and bosses to ultimately defeat a final boss.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">The level design could vary in difficulty and mechanics, but in the end, it must pose a decent amount of threat.
					The core gameplay is to weave through a flurry of projectiles and take down the mobs, continually alternating between dodging and attacking.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">The player will gain a form of currency from killing mobs and can purchase items and powerups at dedicated areas in the game.
					There can be a generic level system put to place and experience can be gained through killing mobs, which unlocks different skills for the player and boost their overall stats.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">I thought this was a good idea because as a player of games, I never exactly got to be put into the shoes of a maker.
					I’ve always been interested in developing a game myself, and I believe that project driven by passion will always be a worthwhile project to invest time into.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">Obstacles we can anticipate are most likely and truthfully, making the game too complicated. The point of this game is to make it both simple and enjoyable,
					so we need to constantly remind ourselves of that, or else we might run out of time.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">While on the topic of complexity and simplicity, there should be a minimal amount of complexity, but when there is, we might come across another problem.
					This problem is not having an immediate method to incorporate an idea into the game. This will mean we either invest time into research, or we must avoid it altogether and blandness may be present in our final product.
					This also means a complicated innovation could be very difficult to pull off for amateurs like us.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">Another drawback that we could anticipate is teammates not contributing in any way, increasing the unnecessary load of work dedicated members of the group are putting in. </p>
				<p class="itprtxt">As one of the goals is to also relieve stress, there will be optional handicaps for those who continually fail the stage(s), to power up even more to eventually defeat a hard boss.</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">The gameplay must be satisfying, so impressive, natural and fluid animations along with appropriate audio will contribute to that satisfaction.</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">For hardcore players, there can be a mode where the purpose is to beat the game as fast as possible, under the hardest difficulty where the bosses have upscaled health and more mechanics are present,
					and the fastest speeds are recorded in a leaderboard.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">This can enable competition, and assist speed-running, as well as provide replay-ability and more content.</p>
				<br class="itprtxt"></br>
				<p class="itprtxt">To produce our game, we will most definitely need an appropriate PC. We require software such as Unity for the actual development of the game and Blender for creating the models. </p>
				<p class="itprtxt">To incorporate sound, we’ll either need applications such as Mixcraft and Garageband, or we could use royalty-free music.
					For the designing process, we could use any digital art applications like Clip-studio Paint, Adobe Photoshop, etc.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">The skills required for the project include knowledge and experience about the Unity Software, general game design, experience with blender,
					the ability to cope with strenuous amounts of hard work, and a great amount of creativity.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">Finding the skills would be a bit difficult as not many people have used Unity or Blender before, but finding the software would be simple,
					as both the core software, Blender and Unity are popular applications and are free for students.
				</p>
				<p class="itprtxt">The hardware goes without saying, as a great majority of us have either a computer of some sort. </p>
				<br class="itprtxt"></br>
				<p class="itprtxt">If the project is successful, we will create another source of enjoyment for those who are home-ridden or under stress in the ongoing pandemic. </p>
				<p class="itprtxte">This development would add another stress reliever and entertainment into someone’s device.</p>
